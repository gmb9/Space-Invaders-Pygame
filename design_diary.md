              Red glow appears when enemies reach fairly low on screen

I had a few initial problems getting started, however after getting on track it was fun to mess around with the Pygame library and see what could be done. The provided tutorial was also very helpful when it came to figuring out exactly which parts of the code I wanted to edit, and the author was very thorough with his explanations on each section of code he wrote.

I also took some time to look at what other games people had made using Pygame, and was not surprised to see some super creative and interesting projects that had been put together by other people years ago.

In conclusion, this assignment was fun to work on, and it was a great introduction to the Pygame library.
